#Proposal
This is a lightweight propsal for the implementation of a zcoin merchant map using the same system that PIVX does for https://pivxplaces.com/

The functionality for this site includes:
- A Map with Locations Accepting XZC
- A Directory with Locations

This is an extremely lightweight proposal with the intention of getting something going in relation to the Zcoin Merchants concept.
